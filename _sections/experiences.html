<p>I received the B.Eng. Degree in the interdisciplinary area of electrical engineering and computer science from the Hohai University, 
  Nanjing, China. From July 2016 to October 2016, I was invited to join the workshop of Prof. Huosheng Hu as an academic visitor in the 
  University of Essex, Colchester, UK. I had rich research/work experiences in data analysis, IoT and machine learning. I am currently 
  serving as graduate RA in UBCO, and was intern data scientist in Navarik Corp. for 8 months, and undergraduate RA in Hohai University 
  for more than 3 years. During my undergraduate life, I also founded a group and led that group for developing IoT application projects
  and machine learning projects.</br>
  I will graduate in fall 2019 and now looking for a data analysis/machine learning related job.</p>
