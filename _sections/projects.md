          <h2>  AIS data driven vessel destination prediction</h2>
          <h3>Navigation is one of the majority transportation in the world. However, the accurate destination prediction for on-the-way vessel is not available now. Through analysing  the historical AIS records and geographical information, we proposed a machine learning based vessel destination prediction through comparing on-the-way trajectory with historical trajectories approach. </h3>

          <h2><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8243436/">Remote-controllable home system based load aggregation management system</a></h2>
          <h3>The system consists of three parts: Raspberry Pi services, Remote-Controllable Home System and Load Aggregation System. The Raspberry Pi has been used to record related data and the control instructions from all users and respond to the requests from all clients. The Remote-Controllable Home System consists of client controller and client server. The client controller has been developed by HTML5 to collect the user’s control instructions and present the related data.  The client server has been coded to respond to the control instructions from the individual user and load aggregators. The whole system is manifested by experimental prototype, which can aggregate household loads and control them remotely.</h3>

</a></h2>
          <h3>The mobile agricultural sensing system consists of three parts, mobile sensing agent, terminal controllers, and cloud . The  mobile sensing agent aims to collect, process, and upload the measurement results of multi-points. The cloud is devoted to analyze the data from the mobile sensing agent, and reply to the request from the terminal controllers. The terminal controllers aims to collect the order from the users and request the data analysis result from the cloud. The communications between different parts are established under the VPN(virtual private network) that built on the Internet.</h3>

          <h3>In this study, we proposed a wind turbine ice assessment framework with SCADA data by using an ITL (inductive transfer learning) approach. We applied different machine learning methods to the ice detection problem, in which the fully-connected neural networks (FNN) outperformed the others for accuracy and stability. </h3>
